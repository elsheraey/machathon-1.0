# machathon-1.0

Machathon 1.0 was an event organized by STP in collaboration with several leading companies in the field of machine learning. As a representative of Optomatica, I delivered a speech titled "Face Recognition: Tech. that knows you". The presentation covered the basics of face recognition technology and its potential applications. 

This repository includes the presentation slides and the demo that were used during the talk. Feel free to use these materials to learn more about the exciting world of face recognition and machine learning.
